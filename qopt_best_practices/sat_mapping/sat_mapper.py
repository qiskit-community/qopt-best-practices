class SATMapper:
    r"""A class to introduce a SAT-approach to solve
    the initial mapping problem in SWAP gate insertion for commuting gates.

    When this pass is run on a DAG it will look for the first instance of
    :class:`.Commuting2qBlock` and use the program graph :math:`P` of this block of gates to
    find a layout for a given swap strategy. This layout is found with a
    binary search over the layers :math:`l` of the swap strategy. At each considered layer
    a subgraph isomorphism problem formulated as a SAT is solved by a SAT solver. Each instance
    is whether it is possible to embed the program graph :math:`P` into the effective
    connectivity graph :math:`C_l` that is achieved by applying :math:`l` layers of the
    swap strategy to the coupling map :math:`C_0` of the backend. Since solving SAT problems
    can be hard, a ``time_out`` fixes the maximum time allotted to the SAT solver for each
    instance. If this time is exceeded the considered problem is deemed unsatisfiable and
    the binary search proceeds to the next number of swap layers :math:``l``.
